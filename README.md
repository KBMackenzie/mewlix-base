The base library + project templates for [Mewlix](https://github.com/kbmackenzie/mewlix), a cat-themed esoteric programming language that compiles to vanilla Javascript, with templates for making little web applications and little HTML5 games.

**This is currently under construction!** Breaking changes will continue to occur!

Mewlix's base library defines the **Mewlix namespace**, containing all functions, classes and state needed by Mewlix to function.

The `build.sh` script compiles all scripts, put the templates together and generates the `.zip` files required by Mewlix's compiler.

The base library + project templates for [Mewlix](https://github.com/kbmackenzie/mewlix), a cat-themed esoteric programming language that compiles to vanilla Javascript, with templates for making little web applications and little HTML5 games.

**This is currently under construction!** Breaking changes will continue to occur!

Running `npm run build` will run the `build.sh` script. The build process includes compiling + minifying all scripts, puttting the templates together and generating the `.zip` files required by Mewlix's compiler.
